## Runway App

To lunch the application, you have to install Java >=1.8 on your machine.
Then, you can find the file 'runwayApplication-1.0.jar' inside folder runwayApplication/target.

You can simply launch the jar from command line with:
    $ java -jar runwayApplication-1.0.jar
    
Please notice that, inside 'target', you have another folder: 'src/resources'. This cointains 3 .csv files that the app needs in order to works. 
So, if you want to move the jar, you have to export also the 'src' and put it in the same folder level of .jar file.
